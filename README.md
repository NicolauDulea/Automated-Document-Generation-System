# Automated-Document-Generation-System

This project automates the creation of contracts by filling in a Word document template with data from an Excel file. It provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for selecting the necessary files and generating contracts, making the process efficient and user-friendly.

# Features
Excel and Word Integration: Automatically reads data from an Excel sheet and fills out predefined fields in a Word document template.
Dynamic Date Handling: Handles multiple date formats in the Excel file, choosing the most recent date if more than one is provided.
Personalized Contracts: Creates individual contract documents for each entry in the Excel file and saves them to a designated folder.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides an easy-to-use interface for selecting the Excel and Word files, and generating the documents.
